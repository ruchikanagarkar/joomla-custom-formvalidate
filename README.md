# joomla-custom-formvalidate
This is a solution to use when joomla form validation does not show any error message. It usually arises when we try to create our own validation

Example contains an index.php file which shows a simple form validation and also shows how we can upload only csv/msexcel files.

Issue: An empty message container appears without any error message

Output: A message container appears with the message 'Error: Please verify that you have uploaded a csv/excel file!'
